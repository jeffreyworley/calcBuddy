Scenario:
Calculus often times is the bane of every high schoolerâ€™s existence. calculus ranges from such complicated concepts as derivative, series, integrals, and limits. 

The client (myself) wants to create software that is open source that solves calculus problems and shows how the solution was found. 

I want to write the piece of software because often times I will be working on a calculus assignment and I can not figure out a problem and the answer in the back of the book is not enough. I want a program that shows me how to find the answer that is open source. Wolfram alpha has software that achieves this, but is not open source and is not free. 

Success Criteria(in order of importance)
	able to solve basic power rule derivatives
	able to solve basic quotient rule derivatives
	able to show how the solution was found
